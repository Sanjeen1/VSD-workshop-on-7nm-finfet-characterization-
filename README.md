# VSD-workshop-on-7nm-finfet-characterization-
This repository contains my work from the VLSI System Design (VSD) Workshop on 7nm FinFET Circuit Design and Characterization using the ASAP7 PDK.

## üöÄ Objectives
- Gain a deep understanding of **7nm FinFET device physics**  
- Perform **SPICE-based circuit simulations** using the ASAP7 PDK  
- Characterize a **CMOS inverter** in terms of:  
  - Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)  
  - Delay and Transition time  
  - Dynamic & Leakage Power  
  - Noise Margins
