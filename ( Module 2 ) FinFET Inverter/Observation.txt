---> When Pfet width (no of fins increaded ) increases the VTC Curve shifts towards right side.

---> When Nfet width (Nfin) increases the VTC curve shifts left side.

---> When width of any device nfet or pfet is increased then drain current will get increased also. 

---> When Nfet size increased then gain increases.

---> Gain decreases when pfet size increases.

---> Power is increased in both case.
